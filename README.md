# Excel-Dashboard



Included is a jupyter notebook where we use Python to clean the data. 
This only looks at NBA stats from 1980-2010. 
The jupyter notebook cleans the data, removes duplicates and creates indexes for offensive, defensive and overall statistics. 
The notebook exports the file to a CSV file which is the basis of the Excel dashboard


DASHBOARD
-------------------------------

The dashboard puts the data in table format. 
Once the data is in a table format, we can use pivot tables to create pivot charts. Since the data is in table format, any new rows will update the charts and dashboard

The charts and tables are named, and then brought to the dashboard sheet where they are tied together with slices. The slices allow the user to select their filters which dynamically update the pivot charts as needed.
